# Bible Verse Memorization Program
This project aims to demonstrate how the part of speech tags that come with Python's NLP operates. 

## Description
This project is a Python program tool designed to randomize Bible verses and output them back to the reader based on each word's part of speech.

computers can begin to recognize the language we use.
