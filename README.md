# Bible Verse Memorization Program
This project aims to demonstrate how the part of speech tags that come with Python's NLP operates. 

## Description
This project is a Python program tool designed to randomize Bible verses and output them back to the reader based on each word's part of speech.

It supports Python's Natural Language Processing (NLP) features, making it ideal for users who want to learn more about how 
computers can begin to recognize the language we use.

## Installation

You have three tries to reconstruct the verse correctly. When you are wrong, this is the message you get:
